# CPP-Cards-II


<!-- OVERVIEW -->
This tutorial series is intended for those wanting an introduction to *C++* and its integration into *Unreal*. using their scripting language <i>GML</i>. This assumes basic knowledge of a C style programming language and a basic understanding of Unreal engine.

Now we are going to take off where we left with our previous C++ Visual Studio project **Basic Class**.  In it we had the **Card Class** and **Main** all in the same page.  Lets recreate this project and separte the **Card** class into its own **.h** and **.cpp**.
